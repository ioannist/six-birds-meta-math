Ξ companion paper §9 "Data processing and transfer".

This module mechanizes the data-processing identities available in
the finite rational matrix model.  Dissolving post-processing is fully
proved by matrix algebra; the bridge and native-coarsening statements
retain explicit paper-standing hypotheses for the missing Moore-
Penrose/range/isometry infrastructure.
