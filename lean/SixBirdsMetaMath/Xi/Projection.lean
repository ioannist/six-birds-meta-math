Ξ companion paper §5 "Projection theorem".

This module proves the algebraic Schur-complement equality in the
projection identity.  The paper's constructions of `T_L`, `T_D`, and
`P_L` are represented by explicit algebraic hypotheses; the Loewner
nonnegativity part is deferred until projection and PSD machinery is
available.

Projection identity, algebraic equality branch: under the block-currency
identifications supplied by `T_L`, `T_D`, and the algebraic projection
identity `T_L^T K_LL^† T_L = P_L`, the residual equals
`T_D (I - P_L) T_D^T`.
